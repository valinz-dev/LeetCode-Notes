Problem: Two Sum
Difficulty: Easy

Restatement:
Given an integer array nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Initial Thoughts:
- Brute force double loop works but is O(n^2).
- Better idea: use a hash map for O(n).

Approach (Hash Map):
- Traverse nums; for each n at index i, check if target-n is in seen dict.
- If yes, return [seen[target-n], i].
- Else store seen[n] = i.

Python:
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        if target - n in seen:
            return [seen[target-n], i]
        seen[n] = i

Notes:
- Handles duplicates correctly.
- Classic hashmap pattern.
