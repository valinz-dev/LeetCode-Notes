Problem: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Difficulty: Medium

Restatement:
Return inorder traversal of a binary tree.

Approach (Iterative with Stack):
- Push all left nodes.
- Pop, visit, then go right.

Python:
def inorderTraversal(root):
    res, stack = [], []
    curr = root
    while curr or stack:
        while curr:
            stack.append(curr)
            curr = curr.left
        curr = stack.pop()
        res.append(curr.val)
        curr = curr.right
    return res

Notes:
- Morris traversal is O(1) space but complex.
