Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Difficulty: Medium

Restatement:
Return length of longest substring without repeats.

Approach (Sliding Window):
- Expand window with right pointer.
- If duplicate, shrink from left until unique.
- Track max length.

Python:
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    seen = set()
    left = 0
    best = 0
    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        while ch in seen:
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(ch)
        best = max(best, right - left + 1)
    return best

Notes:
- Map of last index gives slightly more efficient O(n).
