Problem: Word Break
Difficulty: Medium

Restatement:
Can s be segmented into dictionary words?

Approach (DP):
- dp[i] = True if s[:i] can be segmented.
- For each i, check j<i with dp[j] and s[j:i] in dict.

Python:
def wordBreak(s, wordDict):
    wd = set(wordDict)
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False]*(n+1)
    dp[0] = True
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i):
            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in wd:
                dp[i] = True
                break
    return dp[n]

Notes:
- Use max word length to prune.
